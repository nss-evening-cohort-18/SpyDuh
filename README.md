# SpyDuh
# Description

You are an intrepid entrepreneur in the niche social network space.  Your latest trillion dollar idea is SpyDuh, a social network for spies.  This social network will allow spies to create SpyDuh accounts with their (im)personal details, including why they became a spy, as well as to socialize and find friends with similar skills.  You'll also be wanting a way to monetize this app, so having a section that allows for the listing of services is your entryway to the real money.  

You'll be building this in teams, and we're only concerned with building the API right now.
Your first task as a team will be to break down the following requirements into smaller chunks.  You are welcome to work on some tasks together, but everyone will need to have commits with substance.
